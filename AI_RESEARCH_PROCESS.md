| Model | Input Cost/1K tokens | Output Cost/1K tokens |
|-------|---------------------|----------------------|
| x-ai/grok-4-fast | $0.001 | $0.003 |
| x-ai/grok-4 | $0.002 | $0.006 |
| claude-3.5-sonnet | $0.003 | $0.015 |
| gpt-4o | $0.005 | $0.015 |
| gemini-pro | $0.0005 | $0.0015 |

### Cost Optimization Strategies

1. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate models based on task complexity
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Optimize prompts to reduce token usage
3. **Batch Processing**: Group related queries when possible
4. **Streaming**: Use streaming for better user experience without increasing costs

## Usage Guide

### Setup Requirements

1. **API Key**: Set your OpenRouter API key
   ```bash
   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
   ```

2. **Dependencies**: Install required packages
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the System

#### Batch Mode (Examples)
```bash
python ai_researcher.py
```

**What it does**:
- Runs three example scenarios
- Demonstrates image analysis, research queries, and chat completions
- Shows streaming output with cost tracking
- Displays final cost summary

#### Interactive Mode
```bash
python ai_researcher.py --interactive
```

**What it does**:
- Starts continuous research session
- Allows multiple queries in sequence
- Shows running cost totals
- Displays final summary on exit

### Example Workflows

#### Academic Research Workflow
```
1. Start interactive mode
2. Ask: "What are the latest developments in quantum computing?"
3. Review streaming response and cost
4. Follow up: "How do these developments impact cryptography?"
5. Continue with related queries
6. Exit and review total session cost
```

#### Image Analysis Workflow
```
1. Use batch mode for image analysis example
2. Or modify code to analyze your own images
3. Review detailed image descriptions
4. Check cost per analysis
```

## Best Practices

### Research Efficiency

1. **Clear Queries**: Write specific, well-structured research questions
2. **Iterative Approach**: Build on previous responses with follow-up questions
3. **Model Selection**: Choose appropriate models for your task complexity
4. **Cost Awareness**: Monitor costs and optimize queries accordingly

### Prompt Engineering

#### Effective Research Prompts
```
Good: "What are the current trends and challenges in artificial intelligence research? Please provide a comprehensive overview including: 1. Recent breakthroughs 2. Current limitations 3. Future directions 4. Ethical considerations"

Poor: "Tell me about AI"
```

#### Image Analysis Prompts
```
Good: "Describe this image in detail. What do you see? What is the setting and atmosphere?"

Poor: "What's in this picture?"
```

### Cost Management

1. **Monitor Usage**: Keep track of running costs during long sessions
2. **Optimize Prompts**: Reduce unnecessary tokens in your queries
3. **Choose Models Wisely**: Use faster/cheaper models for simple tasks
4. **Batch Similar Queries**: Group related questions when possible

## Technical Implementation

### Streaming Architecture

The system uses Python generators for real-time streaming:

```python
def research_query_stream(self, query: str, model: str = "x-ai/grok-4-fast"):
    # ... setup code ...
    stream = self.client.chat.completions.create(
        # ... parameters ...
        stream=True
    )
    
    for chunk in stream:
        if chunk.choices[0].delta.content is not None:
            yield chunk.choices[0].delta.content
```

### Cost Tracking Implementation

```python
def _extract_cost_info(self, response) -> Tuple[float, Dict[str, Any]]:
    # Extract cost from API response
    # Fall back to estimation if needed
    # Return cost and usage information
```

### Error Handling

The system includes comprehensive error handling for:
- API key validation
- Network connectivity issues
- Model availability
- Cost calculation errors

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. API Key Errors
**Problem**: `Configuration Error: API key is required`
**Solution**: 
```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY='your_api_key_here'
```

#### 2. Network Issues
**Problem**: `Unexpected Error: Connection timeout`
**Solution**: 
- Check internet connection
- Verify API key validity
- Try again after a few minutes

#### 3. Model Unavailability
**Problem**: Model not responding
**Solution**: 
- Try a different model
- Check OpenRouter status
- Use fallback models

#### 4. Cost Calculation Issues
**Problem**: Incorrect cost estimates
**Solution**: 
- Costs are estimates based on token counts
- Actual costs may vary
- Check OpenRouter pricing for exact rates

### Performance Optimization

1. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse HTTP connections when possible
2. **Streaming**: Use streaming for better perceived performance
3. **Caching**: Cache responses for repeated queries (future enhancement)
4. **Parallel Processing**: Run multiple queries simultaneously (future enhancement)

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

1. **Response Caching**: Cache common queries to reduce costs
2. **Multi-model Comparison**: Compare responses from different models
3. **Research Templates**: Pre-built templates for common research tasks
4. **Export Functionality**: Save research results to files
5. **Advanced Analytics**: Detailed usage analytics and insights

### Integration Possibilities

1. **Web Interface**: Browser-based research interface
2. **API Endpoints**: REST API for integration with other tools
3. **Database Storage**: Persistent storage for research history
4. **Collaborative Features**: Multi-user research sessions
